Mojo Firebug Extension

In order to package your extension, you can open up terminal
and do the following:

> cd /projects/FireMojo 
> ./build.sh

If you have permission problems, chmod the file or use sudo build.sh.

At the end of the packaging process, it'll create the .xpi file in the
folder above your current working directory. In this situation, it would create
it as /projects/FireMojo.xpi.

At this point, you can just drag it into Firefox or set up your file associations
so that it'll automatically use Firefox to execute .xpi files.

-----------------------------------------
This extension was generated by the Extension Wizard at
http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/extensionwiz/ .
This extension is compatible only with Firefox 1.5 and
above.  Most of the files in this package are based on
the 'helloworld' extension from the Mozillazine Knowledge Base.

You can build an XPI for installation by running the
build.sh script located in this folder.  For development
you should do the following:
  1. Unzip the entire contents of this package to somewhere,
	       e.g, c:\dev or /home/user/dev
  2. Put the full path to the folder (e.g. c:\dev\mojodebug on
     Windows, /home/user/dev/mojodebug on Linux) in a file named
     mojodebug@jaime.bueza and copy that file to
     [your profile folder]\extensions\
  3. Restart Firefox.

Building:

 Each branch has a build.xml for ant.
 Each branch has branch.properties giving the branch version number
   for firebug1.2, branch.properties is in content/firebug directory

ant build.xml files use local.properties file that you must create.

 ant
   builds distribution

 ant dev-setup
   expands install.rdf, and creates links for direct loading of source into firefox

-----


Setup for development by reading the source directly into Firefox:

 Source:
   make directory 'firebug'
   Use subversion (svn) to checkout http://fbug.googlecode.com/svn/ firebug
   Remember the full path to this 'firebug' directory.

 Profile:
   Create profile:
      cmdline>firefox.exe -ProfileManager
      CreateProfile eg "firebug1.2", use "Choose Folder" then "Make New Folder" so the name is "firebug1.2"
      Start Firefox
      Exit Firefox
   Go back to your source, eg firebug/branches/firebug1.2
      create local.properties, here's mine, adjust for your paths:
        install.dir=C:/Documents and Settings/John J. Barton/Application Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/firebug1.2
        update.path=http://getfirebug.com/releases

 Links:
   ant dev-setup

 Go:
  Start Firefox.
  Every time you change firebug source, exit Firefox and immediately restart.

Tracing:

  On the development branches tracing output can be sent to the OS console (via window.dump()). Some ways
  this can work:
    -- linux, run firefox from command line
    -- win32, run firefox from Windows->Start->Run->cmd prompt
    -- Run from eclipse external tool.
    -- in about:config or in your profile directory user.js set browser.dom.window.dump.enabled
 Tracing is controlled in FBTrace->Options
